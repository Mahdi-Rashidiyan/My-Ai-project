# My-Ai-Journey
Welcome to my AI Project Portfolio! This repository showcases various artificial intelligence implementations and serves as documentation of my learning journey in the field of AI and machine learning.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains several AI projects implemented in Jupyter Notebooks, demonstrating different aspects of AI application:

- **Image Classification**: Computer vision implementation for categorizing images
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Natural language processing for determining sentiment in text

Each project includes detailed explanations, code implementation, and results analysis to help others understand both the concepts and practical applications.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
My-AI-Project/
├── image_classify.ipynb - Image classification implementation
├── sentiment_analysis.ipynb - Sentiment analysis implementation

## 🖼️ Image Classification

The `image_classify.ipynb` notebook demonstrates:

- Image preprocessing techniques
- Feature extraction methods
- Model training for image classification
- Evaluation metrics and results visualization
- Practical applications of computer vision

This project shows how to build and train a model that can recognize and categorize images into different classes.

## 💬 Sentiment Analysis

The `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook covers:

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Feature extraction from text data
- Sentiment classification models
- Performance evaluation
- Real-world applications for sentiment detection

This project demonstrates how to analyze text data to determine emotional tone and sentiment.
